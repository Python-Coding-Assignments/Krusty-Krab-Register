## About the Project
This program simulates the process up a waitress entering what a customer has ordered and then getting the total bill that the customer will pay.  The program will prompt the user select what he/she would like to eat.  Afterwards, the program will then print out what the customer ordered and how much the customer needs to pay.

The objective of this program is to demonstrate the following: 
* demonstrate understanding of writing function definitions and calling functions within main
* amalgamate the current acquired knowledge of Python, such as input/output, if/elif/else statements, loops, and functions into one program
* further practice the basics of Python arithmetic

This program assumes that the user will enter a valid input each time the program requests an integer value.  The program's output will result in unknown behavior if anything other than an integer is entered by the user.  

## Getting Started
To run the program, download the contents of the project and simply run make in the terminal.
